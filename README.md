# VulkanGuide

This project is a follow-along of the tutorial at vkguide.dev. It's programmed in C++ and has the same dependencies that are described in their site, and added as git submodules.

The build system used is premake for the sake of simplicity, although I can't garantee (at least not yet) the dependencies will be setup automatically.
